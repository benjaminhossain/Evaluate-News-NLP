# Evaluate News Article with Natural Language Processing

This is a project for Udacity Frontend Web Development Program that evaluates news articles using NLP (Natural Language Processing). This project utilizes webpack and its' various loaders and plugins. Also uses Aylien API to get the NLP data. 

### More about NLP

According to Wikipedia:

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

## Getting started

It would probably be good to first get your basic project setup and functioning. Follow the steps from the course up to Lesson 4 but don't add Service Workers just yet. We won't need the service workers during development and having extra caches floating around just means there's more potential for confusion. So, fork this repo and begin your project setup.

Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install everything:

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`
